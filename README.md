#Movie Trailer Website

This is a project done by Unnar Thor Bachmann in the Udacity's full stack web developer nanodegree program.This project involves a construction of a movie trailer website using python. The code was written in the 
course Programming Foundation for Python but modified by me to enhance the user experience and allowing 
filtering options. I also added all the movies to the project. They are sorted in the order of the user ratings at [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/).

##Short explanation of functionality.

This page contains 56 Icelandic movies, their user rating on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), the plot from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), name of their director, and link to their Youtube trailer which opens inside a modal. Part of the code is from class. I added [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and  [python](https://www.python.org/) code to allow filtering of the set. Many pictures were take from [Kvikmyndavefurinn](http://www.kvikmyndavefurinn.is/) as well as [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/).

##How to run the webpage.

1. Open the entertainment_center.py file in the project folder and run (for example using IDLE).
2. Open the fresh_tomatoes.html file in the project folder in a web browser.
